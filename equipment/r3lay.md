**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
No, I've done other PCB designs before.

**What you are making?**
I'm creating a radio relay tower that runs on 915 MHz and uses my own communications protocol. It will act as a communications point where all LoRa devices on the Trail can send and receive data.

**Inspiration:**
I was inspired by the design and rapid deployment capability Anduril's Sentry tower.
