<b>Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):</b> Created some small ones, but never like this

<b>What you are making?</b>
A long-range, low-power beacon that periodically broadcasts its GPS location using LoRa technology. It's designed with a solar panel and battery for self-sufficient operation while out on the trail.


<b>Inspiration:</b>
Helping hikers, if they got lost out of the group, or even you can mark your checkpoint with this also you can track important gear if it ever gets misplaced on a long hike.

<b>Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):</b>
