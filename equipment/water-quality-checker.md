**Team Members (1-4 suggested):**
None

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
Yep

**What you are making?**
I'm making a water quality checker with a TDS, pH, turbidity, and temp sensor to check the overall quality of our water before we drink it (even after purification).

**Inspiration:**
Could help us carry less water and use boiling, filtration, and purification packets to get water from natural sources.


**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
