No, but I will potentially have team mebers who it is their first time making a PCB.

A raspberry pi powered box, with several SDRs, wifi antennas, and potentially LoraWAN. It can be used as a server, to rehost resources, it can interface other projects, it can be used for heavier computing, the possibilities are endless.

A super useful backpack raspberry pi setup that I had.
