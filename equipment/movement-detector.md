**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
Yep, and my first adventure too. Couldn't be more excited!

**What you are making?**
Even when you're on a known safe trail sleeping out the night, there's atleast a shred of fear about animals (or even bad humans) coming around.

Several detectors placed around the night camp can detect movement using accelerometers and sound an alarm if it's above a certain threshold.

**Inspiration:**
I primarily wanted to make something to increase safety on a trail and this is what struck me.

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
