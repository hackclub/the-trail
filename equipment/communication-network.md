# Communication Network 

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):** @evan-gan, @Cosmin-Mare

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):** This would be my first manufactured PCB, but I am currently almost done with my onboard grant.

**What you are making?** I plan to make a board that everyone would have that can bounce communications around the group to extend the range dynamically. The idea being that people can configure their board for various applications. This will involve keeping all the extra pins in the microcontroller exposed so people could hook up things like buttons & mini speakers to have conversations from the front of the group to the back, with every individuals device acting like a relay.

**Inspiration:** My inspiration is the flipper zero, I like the small form factor and flexibility which I want to mimic

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
