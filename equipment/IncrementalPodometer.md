# Incremental Podometer ©

### Team number : 
We are two : me (@spectralo) and mathR (@theMathR)

### Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):
Yes, i already tried to make a PCB but never finished it and MathR too.

### What you are making? :
It's a podometer, with a game on it. (More precisly an incremental game)
With the 1,8 inch screen (Same as the sprig) and 4 buttons you naviguate in the minigame
The goal is to earn the maximum of point. At each step you will earn a certain amount of points and you can buy upgrades to earn even more points !!!
We also plan to add some "social" features over bluetooh of the esp32

For powering, idk if we should use a lipo battery or Alkaline Batteries
