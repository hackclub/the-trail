Is this your first PCB rodeo?
Yes

What you are making?
A water bottle with Hydration Reminder and Tracker. It will keep track of how much water we drink, up to 5 liters. This can even be tracked realtime on the smartphone.

Inspiration:
I noticed that many people struggle to stay hydrated, especially during outdoor activities like hiking. I wanted to create a solution that not only reminds people to drink water but also helps them track their water intake effectively.

Sketches (if they exist):
