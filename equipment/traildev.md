# TRAILDEV (Textual Raspi Access Interface for Lightweight Development)

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):** @rivques

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):** Nope, I've made the TOTKey

**What you are making?** A small computer capable of running Linux and developing for both itself and for other projects. Runs a Raspberry Pi Zero (maybe Zero W, not sure yet)
and a 2.8" 320x240 TFT display. Keyboard is a bunch of tactile pushbuttons on the PCB. Power is provided by 4x high-capacity AA batteries, for about 10 hours of battery life.
More details in #the-traildev-computer.

**Inspiration:** Nothing in particular, but I wanted to be able to debug/reflash other people's devices if they had problems

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
