**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**

Yes

**What you are making?**

During the hike we believe it's unreasonable to carry water for the whole 7 days of the trip and therefore we'll likely be getting water from rivers flowing nearby and also be filtering this water. Our vision is to make a device which can measure the flow rate of the water being filtered and this can make interesting science experiments, such as what brand of filter filters water the fastest or does the temperature of the water affect it's ability to be filtered.

**Inspiration:**

We have never been on a hike before, we have seen several survival videos on youtube and have always been intrigued by how certain survivalist take water that's obviously unhygenic to drink and put it through what's often a plastic bag and out comes clear drinking water which looks like it just melted from the fresh snow fall during the Canadian winters. By doing these experiments with flow rate of water we can not only determine how fast the river flows this can have more than one use case as it can also determine if its safe for us to step in the river as if the current is too strong people may be swayed by it.
