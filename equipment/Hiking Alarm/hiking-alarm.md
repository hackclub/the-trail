# Emergency Hiking Alarm

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):** @KyleLiao @stati30421

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
First time designing and fabricating a PCB without a handy tutorial. Will need some help in figuring out software features along with decipher some of the schematics and part options.

**What you are making?**
Portable emergency device with switch for strobe light, audible alarm, and tripwire. Would be great to have a few for the trip that double as night time flash lights. Also, will help in getting everyone's attention. Idea is to put everything on a single sided PCB.
