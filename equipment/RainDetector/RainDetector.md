**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**

Yes

**What you are making?**

We are creating a rain detecting device. Whenver the device detects rain it will light an LED and momentarily play a sound/alarm. This device can be placed near water sensitive items to make sure they are not damaged. I plan on having a detecting surface which looks for water droplets and signals the rest of the device. The device should also be as small as possible and robust so it can be placed with other items.

**Inspiration:**

I was inspired by the rain detectors found in sprinkler systems. All of the products I found online seem to use very simple sensors to detect rain and I think it will be a great challenge to replicate it.
