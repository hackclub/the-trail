Is this your first PCB rodeo?
Yes

What you are making?
We are creating a Hydration Reminder and Tracker Bottle. It will keep track of how much water we drink, up to 5 liters.

Inspiration:
We noticed that many people struggle to stay hydrated, especially during outdoor activities like hiking. Inspired by this, we are creating a solution that not only reminds people to drink water but also helps them track their water intake effectively.

Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):
Going to be presented soon.
