**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**  
Yes  
**What you are making?**  
A water bottle cap that has UV lights that shine at the water. UV destroys 99.99% of viruses and 99.9999% of bacteria in water so I think it could be useful in a trail where there may be no safe water supplies.  
**Inspiration:**  
During COVID, I remembered a ton of people having these UV sticks that would disinfect tables and stuff so I thought why not add that to a water bottle  
**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
