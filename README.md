# 🥾🏞️ The Trail
![Trail Postcard](https://cloud-ihlmx01p2-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0trailpostcard.png)

Every year, Hack Clubbers go on grand adventures. This year, we're embarking on the Pacific Crest Trail equipped with only the trail equipment that we build. This is going to be a community effort and for those that make their equipment, they will be shipped onto the Pacific Crest Trail (through the travel stipends available). 

The Trail is a IRL 7 day hike along the Pacific Crest Trail and a 4 week online hiking equipment building event with 30 Hack Clubbers. We'll be building the equipment together on the Hack Club Slack, specifically in #the-trail channel. Please join there to make friends, build your project, and get help from teen PCB legends :)

## Get On The Trail (& build trail equipment)

To get on the trail you need to be 
1. A teenager (18 or under) 
2. Someone who loves to learn (PCBs are  are not easy, but if you're committed, we can figure this out together!)
3. Hacky!

You also need to build a circuit board (you'll hear these referred to as PCBs or simply "boards").

You probably don't know how to build a circuit board, BUT HEY DON'T WORRY! That's totally okay.

Right now, all you need to do is come up with an idea for something you'd love to build for The Trail and make a Pull Request to add it to our "equipment" folder.

Go in the "equipment" folder and checkout the <code>example.md</code> file! Copy that format and PR your own piece of equipment. 

Here are some examples: 
1. Trail GPS-powered Orpheus Compass
2. Electronic Noisey Barometer
3. See-in-the-dark electronic AR headset
4. NFC-based board game
5. Bird sound system (communicate with birds)
6. Custom trail-food stove
7. Vintage camera with filters
8. Walkie-talkie Radio System
9. Silk-screen trail map with a "you are here" flashing light
10. Voice-controlled Headlamp With Personality
