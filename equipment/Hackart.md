** Team Members (1-4 suggested): @ivoinestrachan (sike on slack) @Someon332 (shumon on slack) 

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good): No for Ivoine, (mostly) yes for Someon332

**What you are making?
We are making a cart that can autonomously follow people around and carry roughly a dozen pounds of anything solid or in a solid container. 

**Inspiration: Not wanting to carry stuff! Carrying water especially is a pain, and we’re going to need a lot of water on the trail. If we have a cart that’s following everyone around with their water bottles, it would make the hike a lot easier! 


**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):
