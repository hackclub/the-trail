# Balloon Point Marker GPS System

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):**
**Currently have 2 members but would love to have more:) Jeanelle Lin, Juan Cruz Salinas 

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
**Yes, neither of us have built a PCB

**What you are making?**
**We are making a point marker system so people are less likely to get lost on the trail. The balloons will be stationary at main points on the trail and can be easily detected from a far distance. 
We will be implementing a GPS and a camera to detect how many people pass the point marker/ the last time they have been seen.** 

**Inspiration:**
**Inspired by weather balloons** 

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
Sorta something like this: [Design sketch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3_xbuJYvxjo_XcTr9_j6KffJz-hOCN6/view?usp=sharing).
