# Metal Detector!

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):**

Currently me (@agniv-the-marker) and a few friends from my electromagnetism class (they may not go on the hike so their names aren't here offically).

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**

For me, yeah... One of the others has some experience.

**What you are making?**

A metal detector which will work off the basis of mutual/self inductance! I imagine that it might be a fun thing to have around or useful for finding lost pieces of tech/screws if needed! 

**Inspiration:**

- [guide to make a mobile one!](https://www.instructables.com/Make-a-Metal-Detector/)

I think making something sturdy yet portable will be the fun challenge!

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**

In a hot second!
