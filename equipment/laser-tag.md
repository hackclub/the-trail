## Experience
- Have you participated in a PCB rodeo before?
  - No, we have experience with other hardware engineering projects, like [Winter Hardware](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/DevIos01%26Kiana.md) , and I also contributed to [Production](https://arkade.games/).

## Project Overview
The Trail Laser Tag Project is designed for outdoor activities with components including a laser gun and a vest for tracking hits. Here's a breakdown of the main elements:

### Laser Gun
- 3D-printed for lightweight design
- Contains a printed circuit board (PCB) controlling the infrared (IR) laser
- Powered by a battery
- Includes an optional flashlight for low-light navigation

### Vest
- X-shaped design for minimal coverage and stability
- Features a central tracking plate/module to detect hits from the laser gun
- When hit, the vest changes color, providing visual feedback
- Includes a reset button to return to default color (blue)

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by a blend of nostalgia and recent experiences. The concept comes from classic video games and a fun indoor laser tag session with friends. The NES game "Duck Hunt" was a significant influence, as it brought the excitement of shooting at virtual targets to life. My aim is to recreate this excitement in an outdoor setting, offering new levels of excitement and strategy for adventurous activities.

## Sketches and Diagrams
Here are some preliminary sketches for the Trail Laser Tag Project:
